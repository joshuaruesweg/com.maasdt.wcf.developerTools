# Developer Tools

Developer Tools provides helpful tools for developers.

**If you are no developer, do not install this package! Do not use this package in a productive environment! In general: Only use this package if you know what you are doing!**

If you want to use this package and want to extend it by a plugin, fell free to do so, but do be warned that the API might change without further notice.


## Features

### Language Diff

Compare two installed languages to find missing language items.

### Database Tables

Easy access to WCF's database tables:

* list of tables
* list of tables' columns with possibility to delete columns
* list of tables' rows with possibility to edit and delete rows

**As the database tables feature circumvents many acp permissions (you can delete a user, even yourself, without having to have the explicit permission to delete users), do not use this package in a productive environment!**
